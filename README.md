# Financial Coach MCP

Financial Coach MCP is a FastAPI-based application that provides personalized financial advice using a multi-agent architecture powered by Google's Gemini API. It analyzes your budget, suggests savings strategies, and offers debt reduction plans. The app is containerized with Docker and available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/bensaied/financial-coach-mcp) for easy deployment and public use.

## üî• Features

- **Budget Analysis**: Categorizes your expenses and provides recommendations to optimize spending.
- **Savings Strategies**: Suggests emergency fund sizes and savings plans based on your income and expenses.
- **Debt Reduction Plans**: Offers prioritized debt payoff strategies (avalanche and snowball methods).
- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Uses three specialized AI agents to analyze your finances step-by-step.
- **FastAPI MCP**: Exposes a Machine-Readable Control Plane (MCP) for easy integration with other systems.
- **Publicly Accessible**: Deploy and use the Docker image with your Google API key.

## üîç How It Works

The application uses **FastAPI** to provide a RESTful API and integrates with **FastAPI MCP** to expose a control plane (`/mcp`) for discovering available tools. The core logic is powered by a **multi-agent architecture** using Google's Gemini API:

1. **Budget Analysis Agent**: Analyzes your income, expenses, and transactions to identify spending patterns and suggest savings.
2. **Savings Strategy Agent**: Builds on the budget analysis to recommend emergency funds and savings allocations.
3. **Debt Reduction Agent**: Analyzes debts and generates optimized payoff plans (avalanche prioritizes high-interest debts, snowball focuses on small balances).
4. **Coordinator Agent**: Orchestrates the three agents to ensure a cohesive financial analysis.

The app requires a **Google API key** (set as the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` environment variable) to access the Gemini API.

## üì¶ Prerequisites

- **Docker**: Install Docker to run the container ([Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)).
- **Google API Key**: Generate a key with Gemini API access from [Google Cloud Console](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey).

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Pull the Docker Image**:

   ```bash
   docker pull bensaied/financial-coach-mcp
   ```

2. **Run the Container**:

   ```bash
   docker run -p 8000:8000 -e PORT=8000 -e GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-google-api-key bensaied/financial-coach-mcp
   ```

   - Replace `your-google-api-key` with your valid Google API key.
   - The app will start on `http://localhost:8000`.

3. **Test the Health Endpoint**:

   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8000/health
   ```

   Expected response: `{"status": "healthy"}`

4. **Explore the MCP Endpoint**:

   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8000/mcp
   ```

   Returns a JSON description of available tools (e.g., `analyze_budget`).

5. **Analyze Your Finances**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/analyze_budget \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{
              "dependants": 2,
              "monthly_income": 4500,
              "manual_expenses": "{\"food\": 200, \"transport\": 100, \"education\": 800}",
              "debts": [{"name": "General Debt", "amount": 1000, "interest_rate": 15, "min_payment": 50}]
            }'
   ```
   Returns a JSON response with budget analysis, savings strategies, and debt reduction plans.

## üìÅ Project Structure

- **`main.py`**: The FastAPI application with the multi-agent logic and MCP integration.
- **`Dockerfile`**: Defines the Docker image, using Python 3.11 and Uvicorn.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists dependencies (FastAPI, fastapi_mcp, google-cloud-aiplatform, etc.).

## ‚ö° FastAPI MCP

The **FastAPI MCP** (Machine-Readable Control Plane) exposes the `/mcp` endpoint, which describes the API's tools and their schemas. This allows other systems or AI agents to discover and interact with the `analyze_budget` endpoint programmatically. No authentication key is required, making it accessible to all users.

## üï∏Ô∏è Multi-Agent Architecture

The app uses a **sequential multi-agent system** powered by Google's Gemini API:

- **Budget Analysis Agent**: Processes income, expenses, and transactions to categorize spending and suggest optimizations.
- **Savings Strategy Agent**: Uses budget analysis to recommend emergency funds and savings allocations.
- **Debt Reduction Agent**: Analyzes debts and generates payoff plans (avalanche prioritizes high-interest debts, snowball focuses on small balances).
- **Coordinator Agent**: Manages the sequence, ensuring each agent builds on the previous one‚Äôs output.

This modular design ensures comprehensive financial advice tailored to your input.

## ‚ú® Inspiration

This project is inspired by the [AI Financial Coach Agent](https://github.com/Shubhamsaboo/awesome-llm-apps/tree/main/advanced_ai_agents/multi_agent_apps/ai_financial_coach_agent), a Streamlit application that uses a similar multi-agent approach for financial analysis. We adapted the concept into a FastAPI-based API, added Docker support, and integrated FastAPI MCP for broader accessibility and integration.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

- **401 Unauthorized**:
  - Verify `GOOGLE_API_KEY` is set correctly in the `docker run` command (e.g., `-e GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-google-api-key`).
- **500 Analysis Failed**:
  - Check if the Google API key is valid for the Gemini API.
  - Ensure the model (`gemini-1.5-flash`) is correct; try `gemini-1.5-pro` if issues persist.
- **Logs**: Check Docker logs for errors:
  ```bash
  docker logs <container-id>
  ```
  Look for `INFO:main:Retrieved GOOGLE_API_KEY` or `ERROR:main:Missing GOOGLE_API_KEY`.
